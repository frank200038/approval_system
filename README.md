As this project requires the use of a real database (since it is an applied project), this project can only be viewed as for now. Necessary changes will have to be made (Create database that conforms the code) in order to actually use the system

# Introduction 

<p> The approval system is a functional system created specifically for a graphic designing company (Password and Domain name hidden for security reason) in order to facilitate the approval process between the designer and the customer. Coded majorly in PHP and JavaScript in conjunction with the use of MySQL to help with the storage of each project.
  
  With the system, the designer no longer needs to send seperate email or through other means of communication to send projects to customers. The designer is able to upload each project and provide the customer its correspondent unique URL in which the customer can view the project and either approve the project or propose changes to the designer. Each action will be notified via email to the designer.

  
# Key Components
 <ul>
   <li> src/css -> Responsible to provide an aesthetically appealing interface to both customer and client</li>
   <li> src/js -> JavaScript files responsible to the handle and interactive actions of the website such as uploading, retreiving documents, handling connection with database </li>
   <li> PHP files -> Responible to the communication with the database in server and the client (Designer/Customer) side of the application.
 </ul>
 
 # Future Improvements
 <ul>
  <li>The approval system can be further expanded into an ordering/payment system where the customers will be able to order the design(material/template) directly from the website, and also handle the payment to the projects</li>
  <li> The approval system can be intergrated with user accounts system where each customer is able to create its own profile and see his/her own projects (Now the project is only accesible via unique URL)
  <li> The interface can be more advanced and smoother than the current interface (Better color matching, better design aesthetic that follows modern guidelines) </li>
</ul>
